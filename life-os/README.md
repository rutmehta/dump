## 📱 Enhanced Usage Examples

### Advanced WhatsApp Interactions

**Complex Multimodal Analysis**:
```
User: [Sends video of a presentation] + "What are the key points from this meeting?"
Life OS: "I analyzed your presentation video and identified 5 key discussion points:
1. Q3 revenue growth targets (mentioned at 2:30)
2. New product launch timeline (discussed around 5:45)
3. Team expansion plans for engineering...

This connects to your previous conversations about the quarterly planning session and aligns with the project roadmap you shared last week."
```

**Long Context Conversations**:
```
User: "Remind me what we discussed about the Japan trip planning over the past month"
Life OS: "Looking through our extensive conversation history (using 2M token context), here's a comprehensive summary of your Japan trip planning:

Week 1: You mentioned wanting to visit Tokyo and Kyoto in March
Week 2: We discussed cherry blossom season timing and hotel recommendations  
Week 3: You shared your flight preferences and budget considerations
Week 4: Restaurant reservations and cultural experience planning...

Would you like me to create a consolidated itinerary based on all these discussions?"
```
